to control the interaction between services by providing fault tolerance and latency tolerance. It improves overall resilience of the system by isolating the failing services and stopping the cascading effect of failures.

> 
1. Provide protection and control over failures and latency from services typically accessed over the network   
2. Stop cascading of failures resulting from some of the services being down
3. Fail fast and rapidly recover
4. Degrade gracefully where possible
5. Real time monitoring and alerting of command center on failures
